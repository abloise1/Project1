                I am from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, I joined the Air Force straight of high school on 13 September 2016 and shipped directly to Basic Military Training in San Antonio, Texas. This was followed by going to Technical Training in San Angelo, Texas, where I got my certification in being an All-Source Analyst. Many people in the Intelligence community call us the powerpoint rangers because we strictly create briefs from powerpoints. Being a 1N0 was interesting because I did not care for public speaking but it was exciting to be able to get stationed anywhere. Also a 1N0 never does the same job twice so I have a lot of diversity in my career. I started out in Hawaii as Multi-Source Analyst for PACOM. Then went to the training shop which was followed by my deployment to Qatar in the Combine Air Operations Command. While there I sat on two different teams and worked pretty cool missions and met wonderful people. My last duty station as an active airmen was Tyndall AFB. We were going to be supporting the F-35's but I decided to end my active career. Now I am a reservist at Homestead AFB and I am a student at Skillstorm.

                I have always been interested in beauty and fashion. Therefore, I naturally gravitate towards beauty tutorials and clothing. I sometimes customize my own outfits. I use to like to draw and paint but I don't have the patience to focus on one thing. Since joining the military I have a huge interest in traveling and learning about different cultures. I have always been surrounded by diversity but being in active service you are exposed to a whole new world. So far I have been to New Zealand, Germany, Qatar, Hawaii, Peurto Rico and most of the south and east coast of America. I plan on traveling back to Europe next year and going to at least five different countries.
